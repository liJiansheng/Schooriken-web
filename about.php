								<p class="about-para">Schooriken (Shu-ri-ken) like its namesake aims to be simple but efficient.</p>
                                <p class="about-para">Schooriken focuses on teacher student communication to improve students' effectiveness. 
Over the years, studentsâ€™ needs have evolved and to meet those needs, schools have increased the number of student programs and activities.  <p class="about-para">Students now juggle many more responsibilities and involvement and teachers now handle more students from different groups. To keep everyone on top of things and in the loop is a whole new ball game. Even adoption of technology like Learning Management Systems has unwittingly added another layer of complexity. </p>
 <p class="about-para">Schooriken is developed to solve this complexity in a simple way avoiding a steep learning curve for teachers and students. We believe technology should be simple in order to be useful. </p>

  <p class="team-para">In 2013, to encourage creativity and to bring learning outside of the classroom, the team took part in a hackathon and from there Schooriken was developed. After the positive reviews even in its early stages, the team decided to complete the project.
