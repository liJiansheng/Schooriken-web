	<p style="margin:10px 30px;text-align:center;">No student could count the things he has to do in a day on a hundred pairs of hands. From assignments to training to competitions, a student's jam-packed schedule makes it easy for him to forget about that assignment he received, or that class event he needed to be at. But this is no more a reason to worry.</p>
	<p style="margin:10px 30px;text-align:center;">Introducing SchooRiken, the most powerful weapon of the ninja student. This powerful application makes checking homework and class events a breeze for students, and enables teachers to quickly check on the number of students who have completed their homework or the number of students attending an event. And the highly flexible groups system enables teachers to categorise their students to their satisfaction. </p>
	<p style="margin:10px 30px;text-align:center;">And now, that power is at your fingertips.</p>
